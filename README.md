# About Me

## What this project is

- This project is a basic HTML/CSS project and my first try at creating a portfolio project
- After seeing many other portfolio projects, I've found a lot of inspiration for where I could go in the future with this project

## How can I see the project

- Go here: [Link](https://haydenquale.github.io/about-me/ "My project! Click it!")

## How I hope to expand this project

- I'm considering switching over to using Python in order to create some animations and graphics using TKinter
- I also hope to expand and add other sections like for projects and testimonials
- I also want the project to consist of multiple pages instead of just multiple sections
